# NixOS Resonite Headless
 
This is an experimental NixOS configuration to quickly setup headless clients for Resonite. This is a heavily experimental and assumes (for now) that you're already familiar with NixOS.

# Current and Planned Functions

## Current
- Downloads all neccesary packages to run the Headless

## Planned
- Headless client install
- Headless client updating
- Symlink workarounds
- Resonite Mod Loader install
- Mod fetching
- Optional Cumulo setup

# Known Issues
- You need to manually add a symlink of the system installed `libfreetype.so.6` to the Headless directory with the same name
